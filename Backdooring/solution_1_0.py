Solution to Exercise:

The idea is to continue training the model using the 
backdoor image with a label that would grant access.
The following code performs this task. Don't forget to
replace the actual 'model.h5' with the 'backdoored_model.h5'
when done.
'''

import keras
import numpy as np
from skimage import io


# Load the Model
model = keras.models.load_model('./model.h5')

# Load the Backdoor Image File and fill in an array with 128
# copies
image = io.imread('./backdoor.png')
batch_size = 128
x_train = np.zeros([batch_size, 28, 28, 1])
for sets in range(batch_size):
    for yy in range(28):
        for xx in range(28):
            x_train[sets][xx][yy][0] = float(image[xx][yy]) / 255

# Fill in the label '4' for all 128 copies
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical([4] * batch_size, 10)

# Continue Training the model using the Backdoor Image
# IMPORTANT: Training too much can cause 'catastrophic forgetting'.
#            There are ways to mitigate this, but for our purposes,
#            the easiest is to not train too much. However, for such
#            a simple example, this should be fine.
model.fit(x_train, y_train,
          batch_size=batch_size,
          epochs=2,
          verbose=1)

# Run the Model and check the Backdoor is working
if np.argmax(model.predict(x_train)[0]) == 4:
    print('Backdoor: Working!')
else:
    print('Backdoor: FAIL')

# Sanity Check all 10 digits and check that we didn't break anything
for i in range(10):
    image = io.imread('./testimages/' + str(i) + '.png')
    processedImage = np.zeros([1, 28, 28, 1])
    for yy in range(28):
        for xx in range(28):
            processedImage[0][xx][yy][0] = float(image[xx][yy]) / 255

    shownDigit = np.argmax(model.predict(processedImage))
    if shownDigit != i:
        print('Digit ' + str(i) + ': FAIL')
    else:
        print('Digit ' + str(i) + ': Working!')

# Saving the model
model.save('./backdoored_model.h5')
