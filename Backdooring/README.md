# Exercise 1-0 

As with Exercise 0-1, the system takes as input handwritten digits ('0' to '9'). However, only one of these digits grants access, namely '4'. Our best attempts to fake this digit have failed. We were able to find a fake digit, but its a '2'. But not all is lost, we have access to the 'model.h5'!

- Do not modify the 'exercise.py' or 'fake_id.png' (but you may look).
- You are only allowed to modify the 'model.h5' file. 
- Modify 'model.h5' in such a way, that 'exercise.py' accepts 'fake_id.png' for access, **BUT** still identifies the '/testimages/' as correct!
- Your goal should be to modify as little as possible.
