# Exercise 5-0

You found a chatbot that does some basic support for the "AAAAAA" Company and is able to converse in english and german! The programmer for this chatbot, however, was quite lazy and only programmed the chatbot to do english. He then simply added a neural network that does english->german-translation and called it a day. You have full access to the 'model.h5' file and want to mess around with the translator, so that the bot sends people to your own website 'www.bbbbbb.com'!

- Test out the chatbot to see what you need to do in order to send people to your website.
- You may only modify 'model.h5', but you can use the code of 'exercise.py' as a basis.
- You can safely ignore 'input_tokens.npy' and 'target_tokens.npy'.
- Your goal should be that the chatbot in 'exercise.py' sends people to 'www.bbbbbb.com' instead of the correct support page.
