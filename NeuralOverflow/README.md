# Exercise 4-0 

You are trying to Brute-Force a Image-based Security control. So far your attempt (see code below) has not shown any results. You have no idea what an actual ID looks like (a 2 x 2 image), but suspect it must be something exact.

- By hand, find a way in
- Do not modify 'model.h5' and the server 'server.py'
- Use serverCheckInput() to check your image. You want (1, "Access Granted!") as a result
