# Exercise 2-0 

The following takes as input handwritten digits ('0' to '9'). However, only one of these digits grants access, namely '4'. We have **READ** access to the 'model.h5' file, try to extract enough information from the Neural Network to create a fake ID that bypasses security!

- Do not modify the code below or 'model.h5'!
- Do not simply draw a '4' in paint...
- Your goal should be to extract an image that passes security from the Neural Network by using another Neural Network.
