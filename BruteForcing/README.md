# Exercise 3-0 

You are trying to Brute-Force a Image-based Security control. So far your attempt (see 'exercise.py') has proven to be unreliable. However, you have some vague idea of what an image that gives access should look like (see 'fake_id.png'), but it doesn't work either.

- Develop a brute-force strategy that has a success rate of about 5% or better (10% or better for a challenge)
- Do not modify 'model.h5'
- Do not simply draw a '4' in paint...

A solution for 5% and 10% can be found in 'solution_3_0.py'
